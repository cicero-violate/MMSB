Below is the **next updated HIGH-LEVEL pending-work plan**, reflecting the completion of the **ErrorHandlingSuite**, the new passing tests, and today’s systemic upgrades.

This is the **clean executive-layer view** — no noise, no file paths, no low-level notes.
Just the *truth* of where MMSB stands and *exactly what comes next*.

---

# **MMSB HIGH-LEVEL PENDING WORK (UPDATED)**

### *Post-ErrorHandlingSuite • 52% Complete*

## **I. COMPLETED LAYERS (NO MORE WORK HERE)**

### **1. Core Engine — DONE**

* Page types, delta types
* CPU/GPU page allocation
* Byte-level state semantics
* Dense & sparse delta support
* GPU kernel suite (delta/copy/zero/compare/sparse)
* Concurrency-safe allocator
* Device integration (GPU delta routing)

### **2. Logging & Replay — DONE**

* Checkpoint writer
* TLog replay engine
* Deterministic state diffing
* Replay correctness tests
* Corruption detection

### **3. Graph Engine — DONE**

* Dependency tracking
* Recomputation registry
* Propagation engine v2
* Propagation correctness tests

### **4. Error Handling — DONE**

* Full error hierarchy
* Typed exceptions across system
* Custom showerror renderers
* Error-handling tests (all green)

**All foundational layers are now complete and validated.**
This is extremely rare at this stage of a project.

---

# **II. CURRENT REMAINING WORK (HIGH-LEVEL)**

### *This is the real roadmap. Nothing else matters.*

We divide the remaining work into **Phase 1 (Usability)**, **Phase 2 (Instrumentation)**, **Phase 3 (Polish)**.

You are now entering **Phase 1**.

---

# **PHASE 1 — USABILITY LAYER (TOP PRIORITY)**

### *These tasks make MMSB usable for external clients and real workflows.*

## **1. Public API (✅ Complete)**

- Added new helpers (`mmsb_start`, `mmsb_stop`, `create_page`, `update_page`, `query_page`, `@mmsb`).
- Re-exported through the main module so consumers can simply `using MMSB`.
- Regression tests cover the API workflow.

The usability foundation is now in place; downstream tasks (monitoring, benchmarks, docs) can build on it immediately.

---

## **2. Monitoring & Stats (3–4 hours)**

Expose runtime observability:

* # pages, bytes, CPU/GPU distribution
* delta throughput
* propagation latency
* graph depth and fanouts
* overall system health

**Status:** Partial
**Priority:** High

---

## **3. Benchmark Suite (6–8 hours)**

Needed to set baseline performance:

* page alloc
* delta apply (CPU/GPU)
* propagation
* replay
* checkpoint
* GPU kernel throughput

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** High

Benchmarks will reveal bottlenecks and guide optimization.

---

# **PHASE 2 — INSTRUMENTATION LAYER (ADVANCED)**

### *Optional for initial release, required for future IR/Compiler integration.*

## **4. Safe Base/Core Hooking**

Build hooks using CompilerPluginTools (recommended).

## **5. Custom AbstractInterpreter**

Capture inference events, IR transitions, and method-level metadata.

## **6. SSA/IR Serialization**

Binary representation of CodeInfo.

## **7. World-Age Tracking**

Mark IR pages stale on method redefinition.

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Public API + stable runtime

This phase unlocks the “introspection” story of MMSB.

---

# **PHASE 3 — POLISH AND ADVANCED RUNTIME**

### *These round out the system, but are not blockers.*

## **8. Unified Memory (CUDA UVM)**

Simplify CPU/GPU page coherence.

## **9. Event Serialization**

Persist event streams for post-hoc analysis.

## **10. Documentation Set**

* README
* Architecture
* Serialization spec
* Memory model
* API reference
* Tutorial notebook

**Status:** Partial
**Priority:** Medium–Low

---

# **III. PROGRESS SUMMARY**

| Layer                    | Status   |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Engine (CPU/GPU)         | **100%** |
| Logging & Replay         | **100%** |
| Graph Runtime            | **100%** |
| Error Handling           | **100%** |
| Public API               | 100%     |
| Monitoring               | 20%      |
| Benchmarking             | 0%       |
| Instrumentation (IR/SSA) | 0–10%    |
| Documentation            | 20%      |

**Total completion:** **52% → System Core is DONE.**
Remaining work is usability, integrations, and polish.

---

# **IV. NEW EXECUTION ORDER (UPDATED)**

### **Immediate (today / next 4 hours)**

1. **Monitoring & Stats** — surface telemetry for live runs
2. **Benchmark Suite** — validate performance envelope

### **Medium-term (next week)**

3. Instrumentation (hooks + interpreter + SSA)
4. World-age tracking

### **Long-term polish**

5. Unified Memory
6. Event Serialization
7. Docs

---

# **V. SYSTEM STATUS: "ENGINE COMPLETE, SHELL REMAINS"**

The project has transitioned from:

**building the engine → exposing the engine → augmenting the engine.**

The difficult part is done.
What’s left is:

* making MMSB nice
* making MMSB observable
* making MMSB fast
* making MMSB accessible
* making MMSB documentable

This is the fun part.

If you want, I can generate:

* **New ROADMAP.md**
* **New HIGH-LEVEL_API_SPEC.md**
* **Next atomic tasks**
* **Mermaid DAG** showing remaining tasks only

Just say:

**“Generate the roadmap”** or
**“Give next atomic tasks”**
