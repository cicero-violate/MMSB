Below is the **updated high-level pending work** and **next steps**, fully synchronized with the new reality after:

* Monitoring & Stats → DONE
* Benchmark Suite → DONE
* Tracking docs updated
* New baselines captured
* All tests pass locally (no timeout)
* Documentation set (Task 6.5) → DONE

This is the authoritative high-level roadmap now.

# **🚀 Updated High-Level Pending Work (Post-Documentation, 71% Complete)**

Phase 1 is now fully complete — documentation landed alongside the previously finished runtime, GPU, propagation, API, monitoring, and benchmarks.

## **PHASE 1 — Production Readiness (CORE COMPLETE)**

### **1. Public API**

**Status: COMPLETE**

### **2. Monitoring & Stats**

**Status: COMPLETE**

### **3. Benchmark Suite**

**Status: COMPLETE**

### **4. Error Handling**

**Status: COMPLETE**

### **5. Runtime Engine (Allocator, Delta Router, TLog, Replay, GPU Kernels)**

**Status: COMPLETE**

### **6. Graph Engine (ShadowPageGraph + Propagation)**

**Status: COMPLETE (pending optimization only)**

### **7. Documentation Set (Task 6.5)**

**Status: COMPLETE**

- `README.md` with release overview & quickstart
- `docs/Architecture.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/SerializationSpec.md`
- `examples/quickstart.jl`, `examples/tutorial.jl`
- Algebraic-OS framing present in every narrative (semiring, declarative control)

---

# **📘 Remaining Work**

Phase 1 is finished. Next focus areas (Phase 2) remain unchanged:

1. **Performance Optimization (Medium priority)** — Propagation, sparse delta, allocator fast paths.
2. **Instrumentation Layer Enhancements (Low priority)** — SSA/IR capture, MIR hooks.
3. **Unified Memory QoL (Optional)** — GPU UVM niceties.

---

# **PHASE 2 — Optimization & Instrumentation (Post-Release)**

These tasks are **not required for release**.

### **7. Performance Optimization**

**Goal:** Reduce propagation/delta/alloc hot spots to meet aspirational targets.
**Priority: Medium**
**Time: 4–6 hours**

Current deficits (from baseline):

* Single-hop propagation: ~500µs (target 10–50µs)
* CPU sparse delta: ~200µs (target 50–100µs)
* 1KB allocation: ~5µs (target 1–2µs)

Focus areas:

* Reduce lock contention
* Batch propagation events
* SIMD mask comparison
* Object pooling for deltas
* Lazy zeroing for allocations

---

### **8. Instrumentation Layer (Compiler/IR/SSA Hooks)**

**Status: Not Started**
**Priority: Low**
**Time: multi-day**
This includes:

* Compiler IR capture
* World-age reporters
* SSA graph serialization
* MIR hooking

This is a **separate phase** after the release.

---

### **9. Unified Memory (GPU UVM)**

**Status: Optional**
**Priority: Low**
A quality-of-life improvement.

---

# **PHASE 3 — Extended Distributed Runtime (Future)**

Completely optional:

* Event serialization
* Multi-node propagation
* Network deltas
* Consensus layer

Not relevant until after v0.2.

| Monitoring/Stats | COMPLETE     | 100%       |
| Benchmark Suite  | COMPLETE     | 100%       |
| Documentation    | COMPLETE     | 100%       |
| Optimization     | POST-RELEASE | –          |
| Instrumentation  | FUTURE       | –          |
| Distributed Mode | FUTURE       | –          |

**Overall Completion: 71% (15/21 tasks)**
Phase 1 = DONE. Focus shifts to perf + extended instrumentation as optional follow-ups.

# **🎯 Immediate Next Steps**

### **Step 1 — Ship Documentation Artifacts**

* Publish `README.md`, `docs/*`, and `examples/*` alongside release notes.
* Link the docs into whatever packaging pipeline (registry entry, website) exists.

### **Step 2 — Monitor Real-World Usage**

* Capture telemetry from early adopters (latency, propagation fan-out, allocator churn).
* Feed those numbers into Phase 2 optimization priorities.

### **Step 3 — Schedule Performance Sprint**

* Target propagation (batching/locks), sparse delta SIMD, allocator fast path.
* Re-run `benchmark/benchmarks.jl` and update `benchmark/results/baseline.json`.

---

# **📌 Summary**

MMSB is **functionally complete**, **GPU-validated**, **benchmark-validated**, **API-stable**, and **observability-rich**.

Only the documentation set remains before:

**→ MMSB v0.1 (Production-Ready Alpha)**

Everything else moves to Phase 2+.

If you want, I can now generate:

* **The full new PENDING_WORK_high_level.txt**
* **The full updated PENDING_WORK_detailed.txt**
* **A mermaid DAG of the remaining and completed tasks**

Just say the word.
