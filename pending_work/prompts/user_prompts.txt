That's it. Just the role name. The system prompt handles everything else.

The system prompt (AGENTS.md) tells the agent to:
1. Read its role playbook immediately
2. Read DAG and TASK_LOG
3. Execute the next task
4. Write results to files
5. Report completion

No additional instructions needed in user prompt.
