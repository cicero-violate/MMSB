# JUDGMENT CHARTER

This document defines the **nature, authority, and limits of Judgment**
within the MMSB system.

Judgment is the highest authority in the system.
All execution, optimization, and scale are subordinate to it.

This charter does not describe *how* judgment is implemented.
It defines what judgment **is and is not**.

---

## I. Definition of Judgment

Judgment is the capacity to:
- See a decision from outside its local optimization frame
- Choose whether an action should exist at all
- Refuse action even when execution is possible

> Judgment decides *whether*, not *how*.

---

## II. Authority of Judgment

### 1. Supreme Authority

Judgment has authority over:
- Irreversible actions
- Boundary crossings
- System evolution

No agent, proof, or optimization may override judgment.

> Judgment is not advisory.

---

### 2. Singular Root

Judgment has a single authoritative root.

Delegation may exist, but:
- Delegation never replaces the root
- Delegation is always revocable

> Distributed judgment is forbidden.

---

## III. What Judgment Is Not

Judgment is not:
- Optimization
- Prediction
- Consensus
- Aggregation
- A learned heuristic

> Anything that improves with scale is not judgment.

---

## IV. Judgment and Execution

### 3. Separation

Judgment:
- Does not execute
- Does not schedule
- Does not optimize

Execution:
- Must obey judgment
- Must not reinterpret judgment

> Confusing judgment with execution is a violation.

---

### 4. Irreversibility Gate

Every irreversible action requires:
- Explicit judgment
- Explicit authorization

Implicit irreversibility is forbidden.

> Silence is not consent.

---

## V. Judgment and Proof

### 5. Judgment vs Proof

Proof:
- Verifies correctness within a frame

Judgment:
- Chooses the frame itself

Proof may constrain execution.
Proof may not constrain judgment.

> Proof answers “is this valid?”
> Judgment answers “should this exist?”

---

## VI. Judgment and Reality

### 6. Immunity to Pressure

Judgment must remain stable under:
- Performance pressure
- Economic pressure
- Social pressure
- Reality feedback

Reality may test judgment.
Reality may not redefine it.

> Yielding authority to pressure is corruption.

---

## VII. Evolution of Judgment

### 7. Change Control

Judgment semantics may evolve only through:
- Explicit reflection
- Explicit declaration
- Explicit transition

Drift is forbidden.

> Judgment changes must be visible and rare.

---

## VIII. Agents and Judgment

### 8. Agent Limits

Agents may:
- Propose judgments
- Surface information
- Execute authorized actions

Agents may not:
- Issue binding judgment
- Redefine judgment semantics

> Agents serve judgment. They do not embody it.

---

## IX. Failure Conditions

Judgment is considered compromised if:
- It is bypassed
- It is simulated
- It is optimized
- It is silently replaced

Any such event invalidates system trust.

---

## Final Clause

Judgment exists to preserve alignment with truth and the good
when optimization, scale, and power would otherwise dominate.

If judgment is lost,
no amount of correctness or performance can recover the system.

Judgment is therefore **non-negotiable**.
