# INCARNATION BOUNDARIES

This document defines the **legal and structural boundaries** governing
the Incarnation Phase of the MMSB system.

Incarnation is the act of allowing execution to touch reality.
These boundaries ensure reality contact does not corrupt truth, judgment, or law.

This document does **not** define how to incarnate.
It defines where incarnation is allowed and where it is forbidden.

---

## I. Preconditions for Incarnation

Incarnation is permitted **iff** all are true:

- Audit Trails are complete and append-only
- Formal Verification gates irreversible transitions
- Judgment boundaries are explicit and enforced
- Proof drift detection is active

If any precondition fails, incarnation is **blocked by law**.

---

## II. Permitted Contact Surfaces

Incarnation may touch the following surfaces:

### 1. Execution Outputs
- Results of computation
- Derived artifacts
- Non-authoritative reports

> Outputs may leave the system; authority may not.

---

### 2. External Inputs
- User requests
- Foreign codebases
- External data feeds

All inputs are treated as:
- Untrusted
- Potentially adversarial

> External input never grants authority.

---

### 3. Edge Execution
- Isolated execution paths
- Sandboxed domains
- Reversible operations

> Failure is allowed at the edges.

---

## III. Forbidden Contact Surfaces

During incarnation, the following are **strictly forbidden**:

### 4. Judgment Core
- Judgment logic
- Judgment authority
- Judgment semantics

> Reality must not rewrite judgment.

---

### 5. Invariant Definitions
- Determinism rules
- Integrity constraints
- Authorization semantics

> Invariants are law, not data.

---

### 6. Proof Authority
- Proof artifacts
- Proof gates
- Proof assumptions

> Reality pressure must not weaken proof.

---

## IV. Directionality Law

All incarnation flows must be **one-directional**:

```
Reality → Input → Execution → Output
```

Reverse influence is forbidden:

```
Reality ↛ Judgment
Reality ↛ Invariants
Reality ↛ Proofs
```

> Reality may test the system, not redefine it.

---

## V. Failure Semantics

### 7. Allowed Failures
- Edge crashes
- External mismatches
- Performance degradation

> These failures provide signal.

---

### 8. Forbidden Failures
- Silent corruption
- Invariant weakening
- Proof bypass
- Implicit irreversibility

> These failures invalidate incarnation.

---

## VI. Change Control During Incarnation

While incarnated:

- Core architecture is frozen
- Invariant definitions are frozen
- Judgment semantics are frozen

Changes require:
- Explicit judgment
- Explicit justification

> Adaptation must not become drift.

---

## VII. Exit Conditions

Incarnation may continue **only while**:

- Core invariants hold under load
- Judgment remains stable under pressure
- Failures are observable and contained

Incarnation must stop if:
- Proof gates are bypassed
- Audit truth is compromised
- Judgment authority erodes

---

## Final Clause

Incarnation is not success.
It is exposure.

The purpose of incarnation is to discover whether truth survives reality
without being rewritten by it.

Anything not explicitly permitted here
must be escalated to judgment.
