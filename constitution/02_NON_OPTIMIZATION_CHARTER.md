# NON-OPTIMIZATION CHARTER

This document defines the **absolute non-optimizable elements** of the MMSB system.

Optimization is permitted only where it does not alter meaning, authority, or truth.
Anything named in this charter is **outside the domain of optimization**.

This charter is binding on all agents, plans, and execution paths.

---

## I. Principle of Non-Optimization

Optimization is a local activity.
Truth, judgment, and law are global.

> No global authority may be optimized as if it were local.

---

## II. Non-Optimizable Domains

### 1. Judgment

Judgment must never be optimized for:
- Speed
- Throughput
- Consensus
- Accuracy metrics

Judgment may not be approximated, cached, parallelized, or learned.
This restriction does not apply to policy enforcement, which may scale so long as its meaning remains fixed.

> If it improves with scale, it is not judgment.

---

### 2. Irreversibility Gates

Irreversible transitions must never be optimized for:
- Latency
- Convenience
- Automation

> Friction at irreversible boundaries is a feature, not a cost.

---

### 3. Invariant Definitions

Invariants must never be optimized for:
- Performance
- Flexibility
- Compatibility

Invariants may be enforced efficiently,
but their meaning must remain fixed.

> An invariant weakened for speed is no longer an invariant.

---

### 4. Proof Authority

Proof requirements must never be optimized for:
- Developer velocity
- Runtime convenience
- Partial coverage

> A skipped proof is equivalent to a violated proof.

---

### 5. Audit Truth

Audit systems must never be optimized for:
- Storage reduction that loses meaning
- Sampling that drops events
- Reordering for convenience

Audit data may be compressed,
but never summarized in a way that destroys reconstructability.

> If history cannot be replayed, it was not preserved.

---

## III. Forbidden Optimization Patterns

The following patterns are explicitly forbidden:

- Replacing judgment with heuristics
- Replacing proofs with tests
- Replacing invariants with metrics
- Replacing authority with consensus
- Replacing correctness with probability

> These substitutions constitute system corruption.

---

## IV. Where Optimization Is Allowed

Optimization is permitted only in:
- Purely reversible execution paths
- Performance layers below invariant enforcement
- Resource usage that does not affect meaning

Optimization must never cross:
- Judgment boundaries
- Proof gates
- Invariant definitions

> Optimization may accelerate execution, not redefine it.

---

## V. Pressure Resistance

Optimization pressure may come from:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Economic incentives
- External competition
- Scale demands

None of these justify violating this charter.

> Pressure reveals character; it does not grant permission.

---

## VI. Violation Conditions

This charter is violated if:
- An irreversible action is made implicit
- Judgment is bypassed for speed
- Proof is relaxed for convenience
- Audit truth is degraded for efficiency

Any such violation invalidates system trust.

---

## Final Clause

Optimization is a tool.
It is not a value.

The system exists to preserve truth, alignment, and judgment
in environments where optimization would otherwise dominate.

If optimization conflicts with truth,
optimization must lose.
