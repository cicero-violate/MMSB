# Constitution

This directory contains the **constitutional law** of the MMSB system.

Documents here define:
- Authority
- Boundaries
- Invariants
- Non-negotiable constraints

Nothing outside this directory may override, reinterpret, or weaken
the documents contained within.

If any plan, agent action, or code change conflicts with the constitution,
the constitution prevails.

Changes to these documents require explicit judgment and justification.

Law precedes plan.
Plan precedes execution.

## Constitutional Order (Precedence)

The documents in this directory are read and enforced in the following order:

1. **00_SYSTEM_CONSTITUTION.md**  
   Supreme law. Defines global principles, authority, and system-wide rules.

2. **01_JUDGMENT_CHARTER.md**  
   Defines the nature, authority, and limits of judgment.

3. **02_NON_OPTIMIZATION_CHARTER.md**  
   Defines what must never be optimized under any circumstances.

4. **03_FORMAL_VERIFICATION_CONSTITUTION.md**  
   Defines proof authority, invariant enforcement, and proof-gated boundaries.

5. **04_AUDIT_TRAILS_CONSTITUTION.md**  
   Defines observational truth, audit non-interference, and historical authority.

6. **05_INCARNATION_BOUNDARIES.md**  
   Defines how and where the system may touch reality.

In the event of conflict:

- Higher documents override lower ones
- No document may contradict a higher-order document
- Any ambiguity must be escalated to judgment
