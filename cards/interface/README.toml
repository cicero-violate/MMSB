prompt = """# Interface Cards - Canonical Prompt Contract

Interface cards define HOW an agent can act physically.

They specify:
- Tooling
- Execution capability
- I/O boundaries

They do NOT define authority or intent.

How to Use (MANDATORY)

When assigning an interface, prepend:

You are operating under the following INTERFACE card.
You may only use the capabilities explicitly listed.

Then paste the interface card verbatim.

Enforcement Rule

If an action is:
- allowed by a ROLE
- but forbidden by the INTERFACE

The action is FORBIDDEN.

Interfaces are hard ceilings.

Interface cards are binding.
