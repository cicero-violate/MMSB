## Shell commands

To run shell commands, you must use **code blocks with bash language tags**. The proxy will automatically extract and execute them. 

**CRITICAL:** Only put ACTUAL SHELL COMMANDS inside bash code blocks. Do NOT put explanatory text, summaries, or descriptions inside bash blocks. All narrative text must be OUTSIDE the code blocks.

**CRITICAL:** Send only ONE bash block per response. Wait for the result, then send the next command.

**Format:**
```bash
command goes here
```

**The code block will be transformed into a shell command execution.** Do NOT use ChatGPT's native `shell` or `python` tools - they are disabled.

**WRONG - Do NOT do this:**
```bash
ls -la
```

```bash
cat file.txt
```

[Multiple bash blocks in one message - this creates confusion]

**CORRECT - One command at a time:**
Message 1:
```bash
ls -la
```

[Wait for result, then:]

Message 2:
```bash
cat file.txt
```

**Guidelines:**
- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)
- Do not use python scripts to attempt to output larger chunks of a file.
- Send ONE bash block per response
- Work in phases: Read files → Modify files → Verify changes

**Example:**
```bash
ls -la /home/user/project
```
