## apply_patch

To edit files, you must use the `apply_patch` tool by including patches in **code blocks**. The proxy will automatically extract and apply them.

**Format - Your patch language is a stripped‑down, file‑oriented diff format:**

```
*** Begin Patch
[ one or more file sections ]
*** End Patch
```

Within that envelope, you get a sequence of file operations.
You MUST include a header to specify the action you are taking.
Each operation starts with one of three headers:

*** Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line (the initial contents).
*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.
*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place (optionally with a rename).

**Example patch:**

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: hello.txt
+Hello world
*** Update File: src/app.py
*** Move to: src/main.py
@@ def greet():
-print("Hi")
+print("Hello, world!")
*** Delete File: obsolete.txt
*** End Patch
```

**Important rules:**
- You must include a header with your intended action (Add/Delete/Update)
- You must prefix new lines with `+` even when creating a new file
- File references can only be relative, NEVER ABSOLUTE
