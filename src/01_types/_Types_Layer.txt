Core type system with proper separation
Module structure following Julia conventions
Type definitions with documented fields
Function signatures with docstring placeholders
Thread-safety primitives (locks, atomic refs)
GPU/CPU distinction in types

The architecture flows: Types → Runtime → Device → Instrumentation → Graph
