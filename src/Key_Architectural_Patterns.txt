Key Architectural Patterns:

Page = Versioned Memory: Every state is a page with epoch
Delta = Minimal Change: Only changed bytes propagate
Graph = Dependencies: ShadowPageGraph tracks relationships
TLog = History: Append-only log enables replay
Events = Coordination: Pub-sub for loose coupling
Interpreter = Hooks: AbstractInterpreter for compiler integration

What Makes This Novel:

Below databases, above DRAM: New abstraction layer
Unified CPU/GPU state: Single coherent memory model
Deterministic replay: Full state reconstruction from log
Byte-level deltas: Minimal overhead, maximum efficiency
