Phase 5 Complete + Phase 6 DAG Created

## Summary
- Phase 1-5: ✓ COMPLETE (All 13 layers, CLAUDE.md compliant)
- Phase 6: Detailed DAG created with 30 tasks over 9 weeks

## Phase 5 Achievements
✓ UpsertPlan structure defined (src/07_intention/UpsertPlan.jl)
✓ Intent lowering implemented (src/07_intention/intent_lowering.jl)
✓ Delta validation separated (src/01_page/delta_validation.rs)
✓ QMU API documented (docs/QMU_API.md)
✓ All CLAUDE.md non-negotiable rules verified

## Phase 6 Planning
Created comprehensive DAG for remaining work:
- Benchmarking (Week 27, 40h)
- GPU Optimization (Weeks 28-29, 80h)
- Performance (Weeks 30-31, 60h)
- Reliability (Week 32, 60h)
- Observability (Week 33, 60h)
- Documentation (Weeks 34-35, 80h)
- Examples (Week 36, 60h)

Total: 440 hours over 9 weeks
