# Project Schedule Directory

Phase 6 deliverables are finished. Per request, the canonical copies of the schedule artifacts now live under `project_schedule/completed/`:

- `03_ARCHITECTURE_needs_to_be_updated.md`
- `04_PROJECT_SCHEDULE_needs_to_be_updated.md`
- `05_DAG_DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md`
- `PROPOSAL.md`

This folder now only holds stubs that point to the archived versions plus the active `06_TASK_LOG.md` for any future work.
