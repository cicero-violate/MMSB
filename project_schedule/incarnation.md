# Incarnation Phase

This document defines the **Incarnation Phase** of MMSB.
Incarnation begins only after judgment, audit, and formal proof boundaries are in place.

Incarnation means:
> Correct execution entering reality without losing alignment.

---

## Preconditions

Incarnation MUST NOT begin unless all of the following are true:

- Judgment is external, singular, and human-anchored
- Commit gates are explicit and enforced
- Audit trails exist and are append-only
- Formal proof boundaries protect irreversible paths

If any precondition is missing, incarnation is **blocked by design**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of incarnation is not exploration.
It is not abstraction.
It is not architecture.

The purpose is **load-bearing execution**.

Incarnation answers one question only:
> Can this system carry real weight without distortion?

---

## Core Principles

### Execution Without Drift
- Execution may scale.
- Judgment must not.
- Optimization must never rewrite intent.

### Role Containment During Incarnation
- Proposer and Challenger roles remain advisory.
- Reality pressure must not elevate role authority.
- Judgment authority remains unchanged under load.

### Reality as Validator
- Real tasks replace synthetic ones.
- External failure is preferred over internal illusion.
- Reality feedback outranks internal metrics.

### Edge Failure, Core Safety
- Failures are allowed at the edges.
- The core must remain invariant-preserving.
- No edge failure may corrupt judgment or proofs.

---

## Incarnation Vectors

Incarnation may proceed along one or more of the following vectors:

### External Codebases
- Apply MMSB to a foreign repository.
- Enforce invariants not authored by you.
- Let unfamiliar structure apply pressure.

### External Users
- Introduce a non-author user.
- Treat user behavior as adversarial input.
- Preserve judgment authority despite demand.

### External Domains
- Apply MMSB outside pure software:
  - workflows
  - financial logic
  - decision systems

Each vector must be entered **independently and deliberately**.

---

## Economic Contact

Incarnation requires at least one real feedback loop:

- Intelligence → Utility → Value

This does NOT require scale.
It requires **consequence**.

Even minimal real-world coupling dominates unlimited internal refinement.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

During incarnation, the following are forbidden:

- Adding new abstraction layers
- Redesigning core architecture
- Multiplying agents
- Reframing judgment semantics

Incarnation consumes correctness.
It does not invent it.

---

## Exit Criteria

Incarnation is considered successful when:

- The system performs useful work outside itself
- Failures occur without corrupting the core
- Judgment remains stable under pressure
- Formal guarantees remain intact under load

Only after this may further scale be considered.

---

## Final Note

Formalization makes correctness *provable*.

Incarnation makes correctness *meaningful*.

Until execution touches reality, correctness is only potential.
