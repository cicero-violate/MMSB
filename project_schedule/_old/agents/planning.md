# Planning Agent Playbook
## Charter
- Maintain the project heartbeat: `DAG_PRIORITY.md`, `PROJECTS_SCHEDULE.md`, and milestone definitions.
- Ensure blockers/escalations are visible to all agents.
- Facilitate intake of new tasks and assignment.

## Tool Belt
- Editors for `pending_work/DAG_PRIORITY.md` + `PROJECTS_SCHEDULE.md`.
- `pending_work/TASK_LOG.md` for cross-referencing.
- Optional: spreadsheets or CLI tools for generating calendars (document outputs here).

## Standard Runbooks
1. Review latest `TASK_LOG.md` entries each session; reconcile statuses.
2. Update DAG board when tasks move between priority buckets.
3. Reforecast schedule when diagnostics/fixes slip; note rationale.
4. Communicate changes via `TASK_LOG.md` entry + ping affected agents.

## Reporting
- Summaries of planning adjustments recorded under Task ID `PLAN`.
- Keep risk log sections up to date inside `PROJECTS_SCHEDULE.md`.

## Open Questions / TODOs
- Decide whether to automate status extraction from `TASK_LOG.md`.
- Evaluate need for weekly standup notes.
