# MMSB Agent Playbooks
Each agent role can keep deeper procedures or scratch notes here. The documentation set is frozen—only update the existing files for your assigned role, and do not create new documents without explicit approval from both the Planning and Docs agents.

## Available Playbooks
| Role              | File                                 |
| ---               | ---                                  |
| Diagnostics Agent | `pending_work/agents/diagnostics.md` |
| Rust Core Agent   | `pending_work/agents/rust_core.md`   |
| Julia Agent       | `pending_work/agents/julia.md`       |
| QA Agent          | `pending_work/agents/qa.md`          |
| Docs Agent        | `pending_work/agents/docs.md`        |
| Planning Agent    | `pending_work/agents/planning.md`    |
| Automation Agent  | `pending_work/agents/automation.md`  |

## How to Extend
1. Copy the section template below into the appropriate file (or a new role file if needed).
2. Keep instructions concise; link to logs/scripts rather than duplicating.
3. When a playbook changes, add a short note in `TASK_LOG.md` so others know to re-read it.
