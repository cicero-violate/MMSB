Understood — here is the **updated high-level pending work**, rewritten cleanly, deduplicated, and correctly reflecting the fact that **v0.1.0-alpha is shipped** and Phase 1 is fully complete.

This version is suitable for `PENDING_WORK_high_level.md`.

# **MMSB — High-Level Pending Work (Updated Post-Release)**

**Release:** v0.1.0-alpha (Complete)
**Phase 1:** 100% Shipped
**Phase 2:** Active
**Phase 3+:** Planned

---

# **0. Completed Milestones (Phase 1 – DONE)**

### **Core Engine**

* Page abstraction (CPU/GPU buffers, epoching, metadata)
* Delta system (mask gen, CPU+GPU merge, sparse/dense flows)
* TLog (append, serialize, replay, checkpointing)
* Dependency graph (propagation, recomputation registry)
* Thread-safe allocator + global lock discipline

### **GPU Support**

* Delta merge kernel
* Zero/copy kernels
* PageOps suite
* DeviceSync + error handling

### **Observability**

* MMSBStats
* Monitoring pipeline
* Event System (typed)
* Logging hooks

### **Public API**

* `mmsb_start`, `mmsb_stop`
* `create_page`, `update_page`, `query_page`
* `@mmsb` macro

### **Validation**

* 30 test cases (all passing)
* Benchmarks + baseline JSON
* Verified examples (`quickstart.jl`, `tutorial.jl`)

### **Documentation**

* README
* Architecture.md
* API.md
* SerializationSpec.md
* Example scripts

### **Release**

* Project.toml updated
* RELEASE_NOTES.md published
* Tag `v0.1.0-alpha` pushed
* Files committed and synced
* Phase 1 declared complete

# **1. Phase 2 — Performance Optimization (Primary Active Work)**

## **1.1 Propagation Engine Optimization — CRITICAL**

**Target:** 10× speedup (500μs → <50μs)
**Why:** Currently the #1 bottleneck in real workloads.
**Status:** Not started.

**Work Items**

* Replace global lock with queue-driven propagation worker
* Batch propagation events
* Inline fast-path for passthrough dependencies
* Multi-threaded child recomputation
* Remove function-call indirection in hot path
* Profiling + tests for timing targets

---

## **1.2 SIMD Sparse Delta Optimization — HIGH**

**Target:** 4× speedup (200μs → <50μs)
**Why:** Mask generation and delta construction are the next bottleneck.

**Work Items**

* SIMD mask comparison using AVX2
* Delta object pooling
* In-place delta application (no allocation)
* Benchmarks + regression tests

---

## **1.3 Page Allocation Fast Path — MEDIUM**

**Target:** 5× improvement (5μs → <1μs)
**Why:** High-volume page activity in some workloads.

**Work Items**

* Page cache for ≤4KB pages
* Lazy zeroing
* Pre-allocation of ID ranges
* Micro-benchmarks

---

# **2. Phase 3 — Advanced Capabilities (Research / Not Scheduled)**

These are foundational but not immediately required for v0.2.0.

---

## **2.1 Unified Memory Allocator (CPU+GPU)** — LOW

A unified abstraction over:

* CPU DRAM
* GPU VRAM
* CUDA pinned memory
* Potential future backends

**Goal:** Zero-copy deltas & cross-device propagation.

---

## **2.2 Event Serialization Engine — LOW**

Serialize event streams for:

* Debugging time travel
* Observability dashboards
* Distributed replay (future)

Currently deprioritized in favor of propagation optimization.

---

## **2.3 Instrumentation Layer (Compiler Integration)** — R&D

The longer-term compiler phase.

Includes:

* Base/Core/Compiler hooking
* AbstractInterpreter integration
* SSA/IR capture and serialization
* world-age tracking
* Linking compiled code changes to MMSB pages

**Not required for v0.2.0 or v0.3.0.**
This becomes relevant once MMSB is used for live program analysis.

---

# **3. Phase 4 — Distributed MMSB (v0.3.0+)**

(Not needed immediately, but on roadmap.)

* Cross-node page synchronization
* Distributed dependency graph
* Consensus for epochs / page invalidation
* Network delta propagation

---

# **4. Immediate Next Steps (Actionable)**

### **Step 1 — Publish GitHub Release (pre-release)**

* Use v0.1.0-alpha tag
* Attach baseline benchmarks
* Include RELEASE_NOTES.md

### **Step 2 — Start Phase 2**

Priority:

1. Propagation Engine (critical)
2. SIMD Sparse Delta (high)
3. Allocation fast-path (medium)

### **Step 3 — Keep benchmarks ready**

Run selective benchmarks during optimization iterations:

```bash
MMSB_BENCH_CATEGORIES='propagation,delta' julia benchmark/benchmarks.jl
```

# **5. Summary**

| Phase                           | Status            | Notes                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Phase 1 – Core System**       | **100% complete** | Released as v0.1.0-alpha |
| **Phase 2 – Performance**       | **Active**        | Highest priority next    |
| **Phase 3 – Advanced Features** | Planned           | Compiler/IR integration  |
| **Phase 4 – Distributed**       | Planned           | Multi-node MMSB          |

MMSB now has a fully working foundation, a published alpha release, full documentation, and a validated runtime. The next push is purely performance engineering — and that will transform MMSB from "working system" into "fastest system."

If you want, I can also generate:

* a **Kanban board**,
* a **Gantt timeline**,
* a **GitHub Projects migration**,
* a **DAG diagram of all pending work**,
* or a **priority-sorted Sprint plan** for Phase 2.

Just say *“generate the planning structure”*.
