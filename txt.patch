+# Project Schedule
+
+This directory defines the **planned sequencing and staging**
+of work within the MMSB system.
+
+It answers questions of:
+- Order
+- Dependency
+- Readiness
+
+It does **not** define authority, law, or invariants.
+Those live exclusively in `constitution/`.
+
+If any document in this directory conflicts with constitutional law,
+the constitution prevails.
+
+---
+
+## Scope of This Directory
+
+Documents here may:
+- Define DAGs for execution order
+- Describe future or pending work
+- Describe phase transitions (e.g. incarnation)
+
+Documents here may not:
+- Redefine judgment
+- Redefine invariants
+- Grant authority to agents or roles
+
+This directory is **planning**, not governance.
+
+---
+
+## DAG Plans
+
+The following DAGs define **non-authoritative execution structure**:
+
+1. **dag_audit_trails.md**  
+   Defines the sequence for introducing audit trails as
+   observational, append-only truth.
+
+2. **dag_formal_verification.md**  
+   Defines the sequence for introducing selective formal
+   verification at irreversible boundaries.
+
+3. **dag_judgment_roles.md**  
+   Defines the safe interaction pattern between:
+   - Judgment
+   - Proposer
+   - Challenger
+
+   This DAG introduces roles, not authority.
+
+---
+
+## Phase Documents
+
+### future_works.md
+
+Captures deliberately deferred upgrades.
+Items listed are pending by choice, not omission.
+
+---
+
+### incarnation.md
+
+Defines the transition from internal correctness
+to external reality contact.
+
+Incarnation is blocked until:
+- Audit DAG is complete
+- Formal Verification DAG is complete
+
+---
+
+## Ordering and Authority
+
+Recommended reading order:
+
+1. `constitution/` (law)
+2. `project_schedule/` (plan)
+3. `src/` (execution)
+
+Authority does not flow upward.
+
+Plans may change.
+Law may not.
+
+---
+
+## Final Note
+
+This directory exists to make execution deliberate.
+
+If execution feels urgent,
+this directory should slow it down.
+
