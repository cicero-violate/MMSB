**Architecture Decision:**

`mmsb-service` should be the **orchestration layer** that wires all buses together, not individual services.

**Better structure:**

```
mmsb-service/           # Runtime orchestration
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs         # EventBus, Runtime
│   ├── judgment_service.rs
│   ├── execution_service.rs
│   ├── learning_service.rs
│   ├── compute_service.rs
│   └── chromium_service.rs
```

Each service:
- Subscribes to MMSB via MMSBSubscription
- Runs its bus protocol (JudgmentBus, ExecutionBus, etc)
- Writes back to StateBus

**Memory subscription:**
Yes, `mmsb-memory/src/subscription/` is correct place for:
- `MMSBSubscription` implementation
- Delta stream
- State projections

This follows convergence model: all services subscribe to memory, memory is hub.

**Answer:** Keep `mmsb-service` as orchestrator, add service files for each bus. Memory owns subscription implementation.
